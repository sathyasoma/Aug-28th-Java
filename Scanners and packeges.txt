 
 Scanner(c):
-----------
it is pre defined class.
scanner class is available in java.util.package.

java provides various ways to read input from the keybpard,scanner class is one of them.

it is the simplest way to get input in java.
  by the help of scanner in java, we can get input from the user in primitive types such as
           int,long,byte,float,double,short..etc
Scanner class is extension of object class, and implemnts of iterator class and cloaseble interface.

java scanner class provides nextxxx() methods to return the type of value such as
  nextInt(),nextByte(),nextShort(),nextLine(),nextFloat,nextBoolean()
  
  Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
   
   *System is the class present in java.lang, in is static property of system.
  
 
  
 If i want to give messeges to the end user
                     Syso("Enter Employee Id :")
					        using this meassage end user can enter input that i will take from scanner
							object  "scan"
                           scan.nextInt();
						   int Empid=scan.nextInt();
				nextInt() return integer write int empid.
				  it is the instance method of scanner class =>scan.nextInt()

*recomonded to close scan.close()  there is a lekage 
  
  
  Packeages:
  =============
  A java package is group of similar types of classes, interfaces and subpackages.
  
  two types of packages
         built in package               user defined packages
	
*there are many built in pacakegs such as java, lang, awt ,javax,swing,net,io,util,sql..etc

advantage:
----------
1.easily maintained: categorized into classes and interfaces
2.access protection
3.removesw naming collision
4.increase the readebility
5.searching process is easy

userdefined pacakaege:
====================
if i want creat my own pacakage
write the package name: package com.cg.active;
* HERE it will create com folder within it cg folder within it active folder ther
your dot(.)class file stored. 
  
  
  compile: //javac filename.java
                                 javac -d . filename.java
					whenever we compile like this one folder will created
  execute: // java filename
                          java package com.cg.active.filename
						  
*all java pacakge is lowercase 


java.lang package is the default pacakage for java class,you dont require to write import
